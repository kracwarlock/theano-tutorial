# theano-tutorial
This repository contains the IPython Notebook files for the 1-hour Theano tutorial
I presented at the Toronto Machine Learning and Deep Learning group on October 16,
2015.

## Instructions to run these tutorials

Install IPython Notebook:
```
http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html
```
Download the tutorials:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:kracwarlock/theano-tutorial.git
```
Launch the server:
```
$ ipython notebook theano-tutorial
```
A new window or tab would open in your web browser. If it does not (or if you
want to use it in a different browser), the previous command should mention a
URL you can open, most probably <http://localhost:8888/>
